## How to build?

First of all make sure to navigate in the Root `CMakeLists.txt ` file and rename the variables as you wish. It's important to rename the folders aswell!. (They are on line 1-3). Sorry i was to lazy to create a setup file.

- Create a `Build` dir
- Make sure to have CMake installed
- Navigate in the `Build` dir
- Run `cmake ..`
